# Basic-Neural-Network
In this repostory i try to explain basics of neural networks. For that i created a neural network to classify vertical and horizontal black line on a white background.
If you follow steps in notebooks you will found:

- Part 1 :: Basic Classifier
  1. How to create a basic classifier be able to separate vertical and horizontal line
  2. How can this classifier can create his own filter for classification
  
- Part 2 :: Basic Neural Network
  1. How to create a basic neural network
  2. How to rearrange weights of neural network
  3. Adding labels and dataset to neural network
  4. Creating functions (forward and back propagation)
  5. Creating a layer for our neural network
 
- Part 3 :: Testing
  1. Create a test script and control the weights

After part 3 everything about basic neural network should be clear.
